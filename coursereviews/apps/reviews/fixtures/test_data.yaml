    description: 'The visual arts constitute a compelling vehicle for a liberal arts education in a global context. Our department offers emphases in art history, museum studies, architectural history, architectural studies, and architecture and the environment.</p><p>In art history we study works of art and architecture as bearers of meaning and as manifestations of culture, often considered in a historical context. In architectural studies we scrutinize the built environment in relationship to its natural and cultural contexts, firmly grounded in both theory and praxis.'
